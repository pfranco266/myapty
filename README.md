Myapty: my mapty (I'm corny, I know). Mapty is an application let's users track, view and record their workouts on a map. Users are able to add two different types of workouts: running, cycling.
Once users have entered their workout in the form, it will be displayed on leaflet's map. The original project was built by Jonas (as indicated on the app itself), and adapted by me, 
to add additional features/functionality, such as the edit, delete, weather displays, and mobile/responsiveness etc in the app. 

Features of the application: 

Display weather based on location
use your location data to map workout
Form to add workout to your list
delete workouts
edit workouts
sidebar display for responsiveness
save user workouts to local storage for future use
refactor of code for organization
